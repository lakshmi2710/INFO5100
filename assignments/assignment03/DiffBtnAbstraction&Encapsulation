Q10. What is the difference between Encapsulation and Abstraction


Encapsulated class, instance can be created                        
Encapsulation hides the data 		         	
Encapsulation is implemented by private access modifier                
Encapsulation puts together data and methods into single entity 


Abstract class, instance cannot be created
Abstraction hides the implementation
Abstraction is implemented using interface and abstract classes
Abstraction conveys what object does rather than how it is implemented
